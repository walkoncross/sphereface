# *SphereFace* : Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition

By Weiyang Liu, Yandong Wen, Zhiding Yu, Ming Li, Bhiksha Raj and Le Song

### Introduction

The repository contains the entire pipeline (including all the preprossings) for deep face recognition with **`SphereFace`**. The recognition pipeline contains three major steps: face detection, face alignment and face recognition.

SphereFace is a recently proposed face recognition method. It was initially described in an [arXiv technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08063.pdf) and then published in [CVPR 2017](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Liu_SphereFace_Deep_Hypersphere_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). To facilitate the face recognition research, we give an example of training on [CAISA-WebFace](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html) and testing on [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) using the **20-layer CNN architecture** described in the paper (i.e. SphereFace-20).

### Update
- July 20, 2017
  * This repository was built.
- August 9, 2017
  * Most of the bugs are fixed. SphereFace-20 prototxt file (**`$SPHEREFACE_ROOT/train/code/sphereface_model.prototxt`**) is released. This architecture is exactly the same as the 20-layer CNN reported in the paper. A well-trained model with accuracy **99.30%** on **LFW** is released.
- To be updated:
  * Detected facial landmarks, training image list, training log and extracted features will be released soon.

### Disclaimer
1. **Backward gradient.**
	- In this implementation, we did not strictly follow the equations in paper. Instead, we normalize the scale of gradient to 1. It can be interpreted as a varying strategy for learning rate to help converge more stably. Similar idea and intuition also appear in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04822.pdf
	- More specifically, if the original gradient of ***f*** w.r.t ***x*** can be written as **df/dx = coeff_w \*  w + coeff_x \* x**, we use the normalized version **[df/dx] = (coeff_w \* w + coeff_x \* x) / norm_wx** to perform backward propragation, where norm_wx is **sqrt(coeff_w^2 + coeff_x^2)**. Same operation is also for the gradient of ***f*** w.r.t ***w***.
	- If you use the original gradient to do the backprop, you could still make it work but may need different lambda settings.

### Requirements
1. Requirements for `Matlab`
2. Requirements for `Caffe` and `matcaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))
3. Requirements for `MTCNN` (see: [MTCNN - face detection & alignment](https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment)) and `Pdollar toolbox` (see: [Piotr's Image & Video Matlab Toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox)).

### Installation
1. Clone the SphereFace repository. We'll call the directory that you cloned SphereFace as **`SPHEREFACE_ROOT`**.

    ```Shell
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/wy1iu/sphereface.git
    ```

2. Build Caffe and matcaffe

    ```Shell
    cd $SPHEREFACE_ROOT/tools/caffe-sphereface
    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:
    # http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
    make all -j8 && make matcaffe
    ```

### Usage

*After successfully completing [installation](#installation)*, you'll be ready to run all the following experiments.

#### Part 1: Preprocessing
**Note 1:** In this part, we assume you are in the directory **`$SPHEREFACE_ROOT/preprocess/`**
1. Download the training set (`CASIA-WebFace`) and test set (`LFW`) and place them in **`data/`**.

	```Shell
	mv /your_path/CASIA_WebFace  data/
	./code/get_lfw.sh
	tar xvf data/lfw.tgz -C data/
	```
    Please make sure that the directory of **`data/`** contains two datasets.
    
2. Detect faces and facial landmarks in CAISA-WebFace and LFW datasets using `MTCNN` (see: [MTCNN - face detection & alignment](https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment)).

	```Matlab
	# In Matlab Command Window
	run code/face_detect_demo.m
	```
    This will create a file `dataList.mat` in the directory of **`result/`**.
3. Align faces to a canonical pose using similarity transformation.

	```Matlab
	# In Matlab Command Window
  	run code/face_align_demo.m
  	```
    This will create two folders (**`CASIA-WebFace-112X96/`** and **`lfw-112X96/`**) in the directory of **`result/`**, containing the aligned face images.

#### Part 2: Train
**Note 2:** In this part, we assume you are in the directory **`$SPHEREFACE_ROOT/train/`**

1. Get a list of training images and labels.

	```Shell&Matlab
	mv ../preprocess/result/CASIA-WebFace-112X96 data/
	# In Matlab Command Window
	run code/get_list.m
	```
    The aligned face images in folder **`CASIA-WebFace-112X96/`** are moved from ***preprocess*** folder to ***train*** folder. A list `CASIA-WebFace-112X96.txt` is created in the directory of **`data/`** for the subsequent training.

2. Train the sphereface model.

	```Shell
	./code/sphereface/sphereface_train.sh 0,1
	```
    After training, a model `sphereface_model_iter_28000.caffemodel` and a corresponding log file `sphereface_train.log` are placed in the directory of `result/sphereface/`.

#### Part 3: Test
**Note 3:** In this part, we assume you are in the directory **`$SPHEREFACE_ROOT/test/`**

1. Get the pair list of LFW ([view 2](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/#views)).

	```Shell
	mv ../preprocess/result/lfw-112X96 data/
	./code/get_pairs.sh
	```
	Make sure that the LFW dataset and`pairs.txt` in the directory of **`data/`**

1. Extract deep features and test on LFW.

	```Matlab
	# In Matlab Command Window
	run code/evaluation.m
	```
    Finally we have the `sphereface_model.caffemodel`, extracted features `pairs.mat` in folder **`result/`**, and accuracy on LFW like this:

	fold|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|AVE
	:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
	ACC|99.33%|99.17%|98.83%|99.50%|99.17%|99.83%|99.17%|98.83%|99.83%|99.33%|99.30%

### Models

	Experiment |#1|#2|#3 (released)|#4|#5
	:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
	ACC|99.24%|99.20%|**99.30%**|99.27%|99.13%
